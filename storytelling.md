# Designing Mindful Living  
<br><br>
<br><br>
My story begins where _**the mountains**_ rise sharp against the sky,  
where _**rivers**_ carve deep into the land — and where the human spirit     
still lives _**close to nature**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
_**I owe everything to this place.**_ 
  
To these _**mountains**_,  
the _**wild rivers**_  
and the _**people**_ who surround me.
<br><br>
<br><br>
## The Roots
<br><br>
Growing up, the mountains were _never far away_;  
I spent almost every single moment of free time  
_immersed in nature_.
<br><br>
Exploring the deep forests,  
climbing on high mountains,  
observing wild animals.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
**It teaches you to _slow down_,  
to be _present_,   
to be _still_.**
<br><br>
To notice the _smallest details_,  
to sense the distant _scent of animals_  
carried by the _breeze_.

—feel the _textures_ of the land  
and _sun on your skin_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**It reminds you what really _matters_ in life.**    
_The magic hides in simple things._
<br><br>
<br><br>
Growing up here,  
you learn to respect what surrounds you  
and _gives you life_.
<br><br>
When you take something's life,  
you gain a greater understanding  
and appreciation for it.
<br><br>
Growing your own food,   
and bringing home dinner   
for family and loved ones  
is a _special feeling_.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
**I´ve always felt a _deep connection_  
to the _big homestead_ in the mountains  
that _my ancestors_ built.**
<br><br>
_They built it with their own hands._
<br><br>
They didn’t just build a house,  
they crafted a _home_,  
each piece placed with _purpose_,  
meant to last a lifetime.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**I admire their _skills_ —  
not just in what they built,  
but in how they lived  
with _intention_,  
with _care_.**
<br><br>
Up there,  
time moves _slower_.  
There’s space _to breathe_,  
to feel what it means _to truly live_.  
<br><br>
And when people come _**together**_ —    
to help build a roof,  
to split wood,  
to share a meal —  
you see what _**community**_ really means.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**This is the legacy they left behind.  
Not just the house,  
but the _way of life_.**
<br><br>
_The values.  
The strength.  
The quiet resilience._  
<br><br>
<br><br>
_That quiet resilience  
is alive in my father._
<br><br>

<br><br>
**Mountaineer.  
Ultra runner.  
Botanist.**
<br><br>
He told me stories  
about distant lands,  
about mountains   
few have seen,  
nights under stars,  
and days spent alone  
in the wilderness.  
<br><br>
He taught me about _**freedom**_.  
And _**loss**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
_**From him — I got the wild spirit.**_
<br><br>
While other girls wanted to be _princesses_,  
I wanted to be a _climber_.  
An _adventurer_.  
<br><br>
_To hit the road and immerse myself    
in new experiences, new cultures,  
new sights, new smells,  
new people..._
<br><br>
To build my _off-grid cabin,_  
and learn the language of the land.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**And from my mum — I learned how to live with the shadow of death.**_
<br><br>
A doctor.  
Head of radiation oncology department.  
Surrounded by death every single day.  
  
_**And so was I.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
I grew up learning to _accept mortality_,  
not with _fear_, but with _peace_.
<br><br>

It taught me to live with _awareness_.  
To truly appreciate each moment,  
to live _mindfully_.

## Croak Like No One Is Pondering!
<br><br>
<br><br>
**For a long time, I didn’t know why  
I loved the things I do.**
<br><br>
_The adventure.  
The challenge.    
The unknown._
<br><br>
<br><br>
I found my _flow state_ through  
pushing _my limits_.
<br><br>
Long-distance running,  
Rock climbing,  
Freediving, ...  
<br><br>
**In those moments, you're right there.  
In the present.  
Alive.**
<br><br>
There’s no room for _pretense_.  
No space for _polished labels_.   
No use for _shiny words_.
<br><br>
_**It brings out the realness  
and rawness of who you are  
—whether you like it or not.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
## Lessons from the Wild
<br><br>
_**All those experiences shaped me.**_ 
  
The wilderness is my _greatest teacher_.  
It taught me to live slowly, to be present,  
to enjoy simple things.  
<br><br>
<br><br>
**The wilderness showed me   
what really matters in life.**
  
_But the world outside told me I needed **MORE**._
<br><br>
<br><br>
**Yesterday’s luxuries become today’s necessities.**  
<br><br>
Chasing shiny things—  
_possessions, status, validation._  

    
_This is what it means to be free?_
<br><br>
Smart enough to do our job,  
but not to question **WHY** we do it.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**They gave us _money_, and in return we gave them _the world_.**
<br><br>
In just a few decades, the world has shifted beneath our feet.  
What once took centuries now happens in the blink of an eye.
  
_And while rushing forward, we **forgot how to live**._  
<br><br>
<br><br>
We aren’t ready to move _**this fast**_.

Our minds can’t process it all.  
Our bodies can’t carry the weight.  
And still, we run—  
  
 _**faster and faster.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
**Technology has rewired everything—  
the way we think, the way we connect,  
the way we exist.**
<br><br>
Once, information was scarce.  
Now, we’re drowning in it.  
<br><br>
_Every scroll, every click—  
how much of it is truly nourishing?  
How much is engineered to addict, to divide, to manipulate?_  
<br><br>
We’re becoming so disconnected—  
so distrustful.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**If you give good people bad information,  
they make bad decisions.**
<br><br>
<br><br>
## The Great Storytellers
<br><br>
_What if the most dangerous tool humanity ever created wasn´t a **weapon**,  
but a **story**?_
<br><br>
<br><br>
_The ones who **craft the stories** hold the power to influence those,  
who merely know the **facts**._
  
We accept the reality of the world with which we´re presented.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_We are **NOT** just designers._  
<br><br>
Every **choice** we make—every ad, every product, every interface—  
ripples far beyond the brief.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_We influence what people desire,  
what they think they need,  
and what they strive for_.  
<br><br>
<br><br>
It’s never just _**aesthetics**_.    
It’s a _**tool**_ to shape _behaviors, beliefs, and systems_.
<br><br>
_We are **NOT** just designers._  
_We are **Architects of Culture**._
<br><br>
Crisis is time of decisions - _**important decisions**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Decisions we don’t always realize we’re making.  
The danger sneaks in _quietly_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**Don´t let the paycheck   
become an excuse.**
<br><br>
<br><br>
## Into The Wild
<br><br>
And after 3 years of studying here,  
it taught me everything I _don’t_ want to do.  
Everything I _refuse_ to become.
<br><br>
Project after project —  
just deliver, don’t question.  
Make it look good.  
Make it sell.  
  
_Don’t ask if it’s right or wrong._
<br><br>
<br><br>
**They taught us how to build brands,  
how to shape _desire_ —  
but never asked who we were shaping it for.**
  
**Or why.**
<br><br>
<br><br>
It showed me a different world —  
one of deadlines, titles, and polished portfolios.  
A world that moves _fast_,  
but rarely asks _why_.  
<br><br>
I didn’t come here to _chase success_.  
To climb a ladder _I don’t believe in_.  
To make things that look good,  
but feel _empty_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
I came to _understand the world_.  
To experience its _complexity_,  
to challenge the _familiar_.  
<br><br>
<br><br>
![into the wildň](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f28965-7528-4d2d-948d-f7c5d3ceedc9)
<br><br>
<br><br>
**But now, I know it’s _time to go_.  
To _walk away_.  
To _return to the wild_.**
<br><br>
<br><br>
To build a homestead.  
To become more self-sufficient.  
To live close to nature.
<br><br>
Hit the road.  
Immerse myself in new places, new cultures.  
To create not for _clients_, but for _communities_.

To tell stories that _matter_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
I’ve never seen myself _**just**_ as a designer.  
Design is a _**powerful**_ tool.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_To educate._  
_To inspire._
  
_To build a better world._ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
In a world where it´s easier to be _**apathetic**_,  
caring is the ultimate _**Act of Rebellion**_.
<br><br>
_To pay **attention**._  
_To be **intentional**._
<br><br>
_To create like it **matters**._
<br><br>
<br><br>
I may not have all the _**answers**_ yet.    
Maybe I _**never**_ will.
<br><br>
<br><br>
But I know what I stand for.  
  
_**I design mindful living.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**PS: Don´t get trapped in slavery     
with distraction and    
some comfort.**_
